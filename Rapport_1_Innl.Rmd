## Results and discussion

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(readxl)
library (tidyverse)

  reliability_data <- read_excel("reliability_data.xlsx") %>%
  mutate (diff = Pre - Post) %>%
  
  summarise (s = sd (diff),
    te = s / sqrt (2), 
    m = mean (c(Pre, Post)), 
    cv = (te/m) * 100) 
  
  cv <- round(reliability_data$cv, 2)
  

```


The typical error of the test was `r cv`%.
